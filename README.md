* **Firefox is saying there more tabs when I close it**
  
It's normal! If you want to see the tab press CTRL+TAB  to see the other tabs. You can close it pressing CTRL+W

* **I have to connect with the same accounts every time!**
  
  Firefox profile save your accounts in different folders. So every time you create a new app you have to connect with your account again.
